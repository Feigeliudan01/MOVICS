The goal of MOVICS is to provide a unified interface for 10 state-of-the-art multi-omics clustering algorithms, and standardizes the output for each algorithm so as to form a pipeline for downstream analyses. For cancer subtyping studies, MOVICS forms a pipeline for most commonly used downstream analyses in cancer subtyping researches and to create feature rich customizable visualzations with minimal effort.

A detailed guide of how to use MOVICS could be find in the HTML vignette.
